## Generator Reinforcement Learning Cases Package

> Uses the game Iver's Tales https://iguanago.itch.io/ivers-tales as a base for all the models, environment and player controller. 

## About me
 Tool for generating environments that can train an agent model for achieving whatever task is needed. Uses the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm of the ML-Agents library for developing a trained neural network.
